### Don't waste your time. You only execute python3 process_4.py
    python3 process_1.py 
    python3 process_2.py
    python3 process_3.py 
    python3 process_4.py 
    where process_1.py,process_2.py are data process. (need 20 minate)
          + process_3.py is the graph construction (need 5 hour)
          + process_4.py is training model and evaluation.


The results will show the performance of RetaGNN-NLP by classification metric Accuracy, Recall, Precision and F1-Score.
